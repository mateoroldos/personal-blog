After studying design for 5 years I realized that the secret of good design is applying a few basic principles.
I couldn't believe how simple it was. I'll share with you the most important ones, so you don't have to spend 5 years learning them.

UI design is about clarity and usability. The secret is keeping things simple. A well-designed interface with fewer elements will be more user-friendly than a complex one. Don't overcomplicate it.

Simple means getting rid of unnecessary elements. Don't add extra buttons or icons when you can achieve the same result with fewer. Every element should serve a purpose.

Learn how the brain reads information. Users start reading from top-left and end in bottom-right. Use this to your advantage.

Don't invent new ways to do things. Use patterns that are already known. Users are used to them and will feel more comfortable.

Making your design aesthetic is a secondary step. Polish the elements you already have — typography, colors and space.

**Typography**

- Use a maximum of 2 fonts.
- For long texts use a simple and easy to read font.
- For titles use a more expressive font (optional).
- For hierarchy use **font-size** and **font-weight**

**Colors**

- Use few colors, a primary color + neutrals is enough.
- For important elements use your primary colors.
- For success actions use green.
- For danger actions use red.
- For everything else use neutrals.

**Space**

- Give enough space between elements so they don't look tight.

Break this rules only if you have a good reason to do so.

That’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good UI design. You’re welcome.
