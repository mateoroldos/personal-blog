_Inspired by [The day you became a better writer](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html) by Scott Adams._

I studied design for 5 years. But I didn't become a good designer until I realized that **good design is just about applying a few basic principles.** I couldn't believe how simple it was. I'll share with you the most important ones so you don't have to spend 5 years to learn them.

UI design is about clarity and usability. The secret is keeping things simple. A well-designed interface with fewer elements will be more user-friendly than a complex one. **Every element should have a purpose**.

Don't invent new ways to do things. Use patterns that are already known. **Users are used to them and will feel more comfortable**.

Learn how the brain reads information. **Users start reading from the top-left and end in the bottom-right**. Use this to your advantage.

Making your design aesthetic is a secondary step. **Polish the elements you already have instead of adding new ones**.

#### Typography

- Use a maximum of 2 fonts.
- For long texts use a simple and easy-to-read font.
- For titles use a more expressive font (optional).
- For hierarchy use `font-size` and `font-weight`.

#### Colors

- Use few colors – a primary color + neutrals is enough.
- For important elements use your primary color.
- For communicating success use green.
- For communicating danger or errors use red.
- For everything else use neutrals.

#### Space

- Add enough space between elements so they don't look tight.

**Break these rules only if you have a good reason to do so.**

That’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good UI design. You’re welcome.
